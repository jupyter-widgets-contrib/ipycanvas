    "Using threads allows us to create interactive animations that don't block our main thread from executing. This notebook shows one possible way to achieve this - there are alternatives such as the advanced python scheduler or the use of threading.Timer as in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13151299). The latter was used in [the notebook](https://johnowhitaker.github.io/days_of_code/Interaction_with_ipycanvas.html) from which this example is derived. Whatever the specifics of the implementation, the core idea is to offload the animation loop to its own thread in some way."
