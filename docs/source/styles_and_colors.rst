Styles and colors
=================

Colors
------

The ``Canvas`` has two color attributes, one for the strokes, and one for the surfaces.
You can also change the global transparency.

- ``stroke_style``: (valid HTML color)
    The color for rectangles and paths stroke. Default to 'black'.
- ``fill_style``: (valid HTML color)
    The color for filling rectangles and paths. Default to 'black'.
- ``global_alpha``: (float)
    Transparency level. Default to 1.0.

.. code-block:: python

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    canvas = Canvas(width=200, height=200)

    canvas.fill_style = "red"
    canvas.stroke_style = "blue"

    canvas.fill_rect(25, 25, 100, 100)
    canvas.clear_rect(45, 45, 60, 60)
    canvas.stroke_rect(50, 50, 50, 50)

Color Gradients
---------------

There are two canvas methods that allow you to create color gradients (either linear or radial) that you can use as a ``fill_style`` or ``stroke_style``.

- ``create_linear_gradient(x0, y0, x1, y1, color_stops)``:
    Create a ``LinearGradient`` object given the start point ``(x0, y0)``, end point ``(x1, y1)``, and color stops.
- ``create_radial_gradient(x0, y0, r0, x1, y1, r1, color_stops)``:
    Create a ``RadialGradient`` object given the start circle ``(x0, y0, r0)``, end circle ``(x1, y1, r1)``, and color stops.

You need to provide the start point and end point of your gradient (those coordinates are global to the entire canvas, it's not per-shape).
The color stops is a list of tuple ``(offset, color)``, ``offset`` being a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, representing the position of the
color stop. 0 represents the start of the gradient and 1 represents the end.

.. code-block:: python

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    canvas = Canvas(width=700, height=50)

    gradient = canvas.create_linear_gradient(
        0,
        0,  # Start position (x0, y0)
        700,
        0,  # End position (x1, y1)
        # List of color stops
        [
            (0, "red"),
            (1 / 6, "orange"),
            (2 / 6, "yellow"),
            (3 / 6, "green"),
            (4 / 6, "blue"),
            (5 / 6, "#4B0082"),
            (1, "violet"),
        ],
    )

    canvas.fill_style = gradient
    canvas.fill_rect(0, 0, 700, 50)

    canvas

.. image:: images/linear_gradient.png

.. code-block:: python

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    canvas = Canvas(width=570, height=200)

    radial_gradient = canvas.create_radial_gradient(
        238,
        50,
        10,  # Start circle (x0, y0, r0)
        238,
        50,
        300,  # End circle (x1, y1, r1)
        [
            (0, "#8ED6FF"),
            (1, "#004CB3"),
        ],
    )

    canvas.fill_style = radial_gradient

    canvas.fill_rect(0, 0, 570, 200)

    canvas

Patterns
--------

ipycanvas provides a mean to easily create patterns. You can create a pattern from an ``ipywidgets.Image`` widget, from a ``Canvas`` or a ``MultiCanvas``,
the created pattern can then be used as a ``fill_style`` or ``stroke_style``.

- ``create_pattern(image, repetition='repeat')``:
    Create a ``Pattern`` object given the image source (either an ``ipywidgets.Image``, a ``Canvas`` or a ``MultiCanvas``),
    and the ``repetition`` which is a string indicating how to repeat the pattern's image, can be "repeat" (both directions),
    "repeat-x" (horizontal only), "repeat-y" (vertical only), "no-repeat" (neither direction).

First create your pattern source or load it from an Image file with ``ipywidgets.Image``:

.. code-block:: python

    from math import pi

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    pattern_source = Canvas(width=50, height=50)

    pattern_source.fill_style = "#fec"
    pattern_source.fill_rect(0, 0, 50, 50)
    pattern_source.stroke_arc(0, 0, 50, 0, 0.5 * pi)

    pattern_source

.. image:: images/pattern_source.png

Then use it as a ``fill_style`` or ``stroke_style``:

.. code-block:: python

    canvas = Canvas(width=200, height=200)

    pattern = canvas.create_pattern(pattern_source)

    canvas.fill_style = pattern
    canvas.fill_rect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)

    canvas

Filters
-------

You can apply filters such as blurring and grayscaling to your drawings using the ``filter`` property. This property is similar to the filter CSS property and accepts the same values.

The ``filter`` property is a ``string`` with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    canvas.filter = "<filter-function1> [<filter-function2>] [<filter-functionN>]"
    canvas.filter = "none"

The following filter functions are supported:

- ``url()``:
    A CSS url(). Takes an IRI pointing to an SVG filter element, which may be embedded in an external XML file.

- ``blur()``:
    A CSS <length>. Applies a Gaussian blur to the drawing. It defines the value of the standard deviation to the Gaussian function, i.e., how many pixels on the screen blend into each other; thus, a larger value will create more blur. A value of 0 leaves the input unchanged.

- ``brightness()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Applies a linear multiplier to the drawing, making it appear brighter or darker. A value under 100% darkens the image, while a value over 100% brightens it. A value of 0% will create an image that is completely black, while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged.

- ``contrast()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Adjusts the contrast of the drawing. A value of 0% will create a drawing that is completely black. A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``drop-shadow()``:
    Applies a drop shadow effect to the drawing. A drop shadow is effectively a blurred, offset version of the drawing's alpha mask drawn in a particular color, composited below the drawing. This function takes up to five arguments:

    - <offset-x>: Specifies the horizontal distance of the shadow.
    - <offset-y>: Specifies the vertical distance of the shadow.
    - <blur-radius>: The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. Negative values are not allowed.
    - <color>: The shadow color.

- ``grayscale()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Converts the drawing to grayscale. A value of 100% is completely grayscale. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``hue-rotate()``:
    A CSS <angle>. Applies a hue rotation on the drawing. A value of 0deg leaves the input unchanged.

- ``invert()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Inverts the drawing. A value of 100% means complete inversion. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``opacity()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Applies transparency to the drawing. A value of 0% means completely transparent. A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``saturate()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Saturates the drawing. A value of 0% means completely un-saturated. A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``sepia()``:
    A CSS <percentage>. Converts the drawing to sepia. A value of 100% means completely sepia. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.

- ``none``:
    No filter is applied. Initial value.

.. code-block:: python

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    canvas = Canvas(width=400, height=300)

    canvas.fill_style = "green"
    canvas.filter = "blur(1px) contrast(1.4) drop-shadow(-9px 9px 3px #e81)"
    canvas.font = "48px serif"
    canvas.fill_text("Hello world!", 20, 150)

.. warning::
    Applying a filter can be slow, especially if you draw many shapes.

.. danger::
    This property is **not supported by Safari and Internet Explorer**

RoughCanvas
-----------

ipycanvas provides a special ``Canvas`` class which will automatically give a hand-drawn style to your drawings: see the :ref:`rough_canvas` section.

Shadows
-------

You can easily draw shadows by tweaking the following attributes:

- ``shadow_offset_x``: (float)
    Indicates the horizontal distance the shadow should extend from the object. This value isn't affected by the transformation matrix. The default is ``0``.
- ``shadow_offset_y``: (float)
    Indicates the vertical distance the shadow should extend from the object. This value isn't affected by the transformation matrix. The default is ``0``.
- ``shadow_blur``: (float)
    Indicates the size of the blurring effect; this value doesn't correspond to a number of pixels and is not affected by the current transformation matrix.
    The default value is ``0``.
- ``shadow_color``: (valid HTML color)
    A standard CSS color value indicating the color of the shadow effect; by default, it is fully-transparent black: ``'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)'``.

.. code-block:: python

    from ipycanvas import Canvas

    canvas = Canvas(width=200, height=200)

    canvas.shadow_color = "green"
    canvas.shadow_offset_x = 2
    canvas.shadow_offset_y = 3
    canvas.shadow_blur = 3

    canvas.fill_rect(25, 25, 100, 100)
    canvas.clear_rect(45, 45, 60, 60)

    canvas.shadow_color = "blue"
    canvas.stroke_rect(50, 50, 50, 50)

Lines styles
------------

You can change the following ``Canvas`` attributes in order to change the lines styling:

- ``line_width``: (float)
    Sets the width of lines drawn in the future, must be a positive number. Default to 1.0.
- ``line_cap``: (str)
    Sets the appearance of the ends of lines, possible values are 'butt', 'round' and 'square'. Default to 'butt'.
- ``line_join``: (str)
    Sets the appearance of the “corners” where lines meet, possible values are 'round', 'bevel' and 'miter'. Default to 'miter'
- ``miter_limit``: (float)
    Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes. Default to 10..
- ``get_line_dash()``:
    Return the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.
- ``set_line_dash(segments)``:
    Set the current line dash pattern.
- ``line_dash_offset``: (float)
    Specifies where to start a dash array on a line. Default is 0..
